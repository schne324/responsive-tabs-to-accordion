# Responsive Tabs to Accordion

Responsive tabs that snap down to accordion for mobile viewports

- Fully tested:
    - FireFox with NVDA
    - IE with JAWS
    - Safari with VoiceOver
- No use of media queries, so this will work in IE8 :)
- Just the tabs markup is needed...In mobile views, the dom is shifted around to create ideal accordion markup
